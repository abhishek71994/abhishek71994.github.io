## What next...

The idea of moving to this system is to be able to:

1. Have my own way of pushing whatever content I can make
2. Just try something different, as I still plan to use substack or medium as a way to blog.
3. I dont have anything else...

So the first thing is to move all my content from other places to here.

Then I have been playing around with containers and stuff as well.
So perhaps I can start making content or live streams for others, in case someone might be interested.
With things being free, the idea of monetizing this, feels more stressful than natural.

But anyway... I hope I can make this work. In any case, it's just me and my little space on the internet.

So

- migrate old content here
- Update About me page
- Update resume[Maybe make it downloadable]
- Start the next steps...
